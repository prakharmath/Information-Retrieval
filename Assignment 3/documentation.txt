Simply use python3 17CS10036_TaskNo.py <Relative Path to dataset directory> <output_file> to run the codes. 

A sample command is python3 17CS10036_1.py dataset output.txt
(If the dataset directory is present in the same directory as the code and the output will be printed in the output.txt file)

On my Laptop(Intel i7 7th geneation with peak 3.8MHz clock speed) Task2 and Task3 are taking about 30-35 seconds to run and Task1 is taking about 9-10 minutes to run.
